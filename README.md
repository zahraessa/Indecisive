This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic city-guide skill. 
Provided some data about a city's restaurants, attractions, Alexa will
recommend a restaurant based on the meal type or recommend an attraction.
It can also suggest the current temperature and weather conditions of the
city. 


Concepts
--------

This simple sample shows how to work with an external API call in the skill, 
built using ASK Python SDK. It also involves multiple locale models and how
can that be leverages in the skill.

Setup
-----

To run this example skill you need to do two things. The first is to
deploy the example code in lambda, and the second is to configure the
Alexa skill to use Lambda.
